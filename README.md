# Current-Emerging-Trends

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

For this project I was given the TreasureMaze and GameExperience classes. I was also given most of the project file. The code I created was for the q-learning algorithm to train the pirate intelligent agent. 

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists work to create and maintain all the technologies that make modern life possible. Computer science encompasses a wide range of career possibilities. There is software development, web development, network management, and many more. Without computer science we could not enjoy all of the modern convenieces that we do today.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

I approach problems with a logical and analytical eye. I try to break problems down into smaller parts to make them more manageable. I will also try to find a solution using technology in some way if possible.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

computer scientists have an ethical responsibility to prevent harm to their users. They are responsibile for not creating malicious software on purpose. they have a responsibility to their organization to maintain proprietary company property which could come in the form of code they write for the company.
